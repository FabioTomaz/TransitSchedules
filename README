Routing algorithm:
-> Load all stop (node) connections at beginning 
-> Two nodes have a connection between two nodes if they are below 2km away or if they are indeed connected through the same agency
-> The cost between nodes is based on the time between them
-> For near nodes we consider walk speed and distance between node coordinates as a way for getting time between those two nodes
-> We load all this data to an in memory data structure for the later use of the djikstra algorithm 
-> When new gtfs is added we do the same procedure for the added nodes
-> We consider connections as two directional
-> Whenever we need to compute paths between nodes (stops) we use djikstra algorithm to get the path
-> After getting the path we add up the time and the fares 
-> After getting fares, path, time we parse all of this to the json format "RouteMapping" (defined in the OpenAPI 3.0 Documentation) and return the result
